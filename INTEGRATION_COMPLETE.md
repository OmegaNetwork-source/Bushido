# ✅ Blockchain Leaderboard Integration Complete!

## 🎉 What's Been Integrated

Your Bushido Duel game is now fully integrated with the blockchain leaderboard smart contract deployed on Somnia Mainnet!

**Contract Address:** `0x8990bbf7ab7fe6bd146ddc066ca7c88773c1cc9b`

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. **Leaderboard.jsx** ✅
- Now fetches data from the smart contract on Somnia Network
- Displays top 100 players by wins
- Uses read-only RPC connection (no wallet needed to view)
- Shows wins, losses, and wallet addresses

### 2. **BushidoDuelGame.jsx** ✅
- "Save Win" button replaced with "Submit Victory"
- Records wins directly on the blockchain
- Shows loading state during transaction
- Success message confirms blockchain recording
- Users pay gas to record their wins

### 3. **Contract Integration Files** ✅
- `contracts/IntegrationExample.js` - Updated with your contract address and ABI
- `contracts/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` - Complete documentation
- `contracts/QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference guide
- `contracts/UniversalLeaderboard.sol` - Smart contract source code

## 🚀 Next Steps - IMPORTANT!

### Step 1: Authorize Your Wallet
Before the game can record wins, you need to authorize your wallet in the smart contract.

**In Remix IDE:**
1. Open your deployed contract at `0x8990bbf7ab7fe6bd146ddc066ca7c88773c1cc9b`
2. Call the `authorizeGame` function
3. Enter **YOUR WALLET ADDRESS** as the parameter
4. Click "transact" and confirm in MetaMask

**Example:**
```
authorizeGame("0xYourWalletAddressHere")
```

This allows your wallet to record wins on the leaderboard.

### Step 2: Test the Integration

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Connect MetaMask to Somnia Mainnet**
   - Network: Somnia Mainnet
   - RPC: https://api.infra.mainnet.somnia.network/
   - Chain ID: 5071

3. **Play the game and win**

4. **Click "Submit Victory"**
   - MetaMask will pop up
   - Approve the transaction
   - Wait for confirmation
   - You'll see a success message!

5. **View Leaderboard**
   - Click the leaderboard button
   - Your win should now appear!
   - Check on block explorer: https://explorer.somnia.network

## 📊 How It Works

### Recording Wins (Write Operation)
```javascript
// When player clicks "Submit Victory"
const contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, signer);
const tx = await contract.recordWin(playerAddress);
await tx.wait();
// Win recorded on blockchain!
```

### Viewing Leaderboard (Read Operation)
```javascript
// Leaderboard fetches data
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('...');
const contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
const [addresses, wins, losses] = await contract.getLeaderboard(100, 0);
// Display top 100 players!
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Authorization
- **Your wallet must be authorized** in the contract to record wins
- Users can only record wins for themselves (security built-in)
- The contract owner can authorize multiple addresses

### Gas Fees
- Players pay gas to record wins (~60,000 gas)
- Viewing leaderboard is FREE (read-only)
- Make sure you have SOMI tokens for gas

### Security
- Contract verifies the sender
- Only authorized addresses can record wins
- Players cannot record wins for other players
- Blockchain provides immutable proof

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Failed"
✅ **Solution:** Call `authorizeGame(yourWalletAddress)` in Remix first

### "Insufficient Funds"
✅ **Solution:** Get SOMI tokens for gas fees

### "Network Error"
✅ **Solution:** Make sure MetaMask is connected to Somnia Mainnet

### "Leaderboard Empty"
✅ **Solution:** Play a game and submit a win first!

## 🎮 User Experience Flow

1. Player connects MetaMask wallet
2. Player chooses Fire or Water clan
3. Player battles AI opponent
4. **If player wins:**
   - "Submit Victory" button appears
   - Player clicks button
   - MetaMask pops up for transaction
   - Player approves (~60k gas)
   - Transaction confirms on blockchain
   - Success message appears
5. Player can view leaderboard anytime (free)

## 🚀 Optional: Backend Relayer (Advanced)

Want users to play for FREE without paying gas?

**Set up a backend relayer:**
1. Create a new wallet (relayer wallet)
2. Fund it with SOMI tokens
3. Authorize the relayer wallet in the contract
4. Set up a backend server (see `IntegrationExample.js`)
5. Games call your backend
6. Backend records wins (pays gas)
7. Users play for free!

See `contracts/IntegrationExample.js` for relayer code examples.

## 📈 Future Games

This leaderboard is **universal**! You can integrate it with other games:

1. Deploy your new game
2. Use the same contract address
3. Call `recordWin(playerAddress)` or `recordLoss(playerAddress)`
4. All games share the same leaderboard!
5. Track cross-game statistics
